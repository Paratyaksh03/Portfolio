## Stock Market Price predicter

This project is a machine learning based Stock Price predictor model. The user can give it any company's stock from any Index like NASDAQ, NSE,etc or any type of data i.e 1 minute, 5 minute, 1 hour, 4 hour, daily , weekly, monthly, quarterly and annually also. 
Be careful to change the READ_CSV line according to your Dataset and add certain required columns, if not present by removing "USE_COLS" and replacing it with a list of names of your columns like LIST=["Date","Time","Open", "High"...and so on] as"NAMES=LIST" or any method as you like. For AI/ML based predictors, mainly three indicators are used for prediction: OHLC average (average of Open, High, Low and Closing Prices), HLC average (average of High, Low and Closing Prices) and Closing price, In this project, OHLC average has been used.
